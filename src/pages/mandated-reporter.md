     <h3> What is Mandated Reporting? </h3>
        Abuse often goes unreported. Mandated reporting is the early recognition of child/adult maltreatment with the goal of preventing further abuse from occurring. Most of the child abuse and neglect reports are made by mandated reporters, making them a first line of defense.

        The law states that mandated reporters must report immediately, without delay. The products allow busy reporters to submit a concern quickly, easily and at any time via a web browser, a mobile device or a chatbot. There are never any wait times. Reporter login information can also be saved speeding up any future submissions.<br />

        The quality of information received is improved because the reporter is able to directly submit the information in a timely manner. Better information benefits the child(ren) and everyone concerned.<br/>

        Seamless Integration with your existing system eliminates duplicate data entry.

            Note - 
            Non-emergency concerns are those in which a child is not at immediate risk of abuse or neglect that could result in serious harm. The solution is only for mandated reporters to report situations that do not require an emergency response. An emergency is a situation where a child faces an immediate risk of abuse or neglect that could result in death or serious harm.
