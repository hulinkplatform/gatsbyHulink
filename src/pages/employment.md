    content: States are modernizing state government, improving customer service and saving
                    taxpayers money while working to align workers’ skills with business needs. Everyone that wants to
                    work should have the opportunity to get a good-paying job. We at Strategic Systems are aligned and
                    support these goals now and going forward. As an Official Affiliate Member of the National
                    Association of State Workforce Agencies (NASWA), we are a Trusted IT Partner to many states for many
                    years. We believe that these successful partnerships have prepared us to best assist others in
                    reaching these goals as well as close the skills gap, get people into more rewarding careers and
                    prepared for the jobs of the future.
